<h3>Notes</h3>
We are doing 
if(i==nums.size()){
            if(sum==S) return 1;
            return 0;
}
because in the question it is written that <mark>You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.</mark>
So we will check the condition only after adding '+' or '-' infront of every integer.
